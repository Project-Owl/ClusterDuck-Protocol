# ClusterDuck Protocol examples

Example sketches for CDP 5.5. Each example is a folder with a sketch of the same name, so it opens directly in the Arduino IDE, and the root `platformio.ini` builds any of them with PlatformIO.

| Example | What it does |
|---|---|
| [Basic-Ducks/DuckLink](Basic-Ducks/DuckLink) | Leaf node: sends a text message every 10 s, doesn't relay |
| [Basic-Ducks/MamaDuck](Basic-Ducks/MamaDuck) | Mesh node: relays other ducks' messages and sends its own every 10 s |
| [Basic-Ducks/PapaDuck](Basic-Ducks/PapaDuck) | Gateway: publishes the messages it receives to an MQTT broker over WiFi |
| [Basic-Ducks/DetectorDuck](Basic-Ducks/DetectorDuck) | Signal-strength meter for placing ducks |
| [Custom-Mama-Examples/Full-MamaDuck](Custom-Mama-Examples/Full-MamaDuck) | MamaDuck with a status LED, a JSON reading and the optional 5.5 features |
| [Custom-Papa-Examples/AWS-PapaDuck](Custom-Papa-Examples/AWS-PapaDuck) | PapaDuck that publishes to AWS IoT Core |
| [External-Boards-Example/DuckLink](External-Boards-Example/DuckLink) | DuckLink for a board that CDP doesn't define itself |

## Basic-Ducks

The smallest working sketch for each duck type. They use no LED. DuckLink, MamaDuck and PapaDuck share one layout: a header comment, the includes, the configuration constants, the duck and a timer, `setup()`, `loop()` and one function that sends or publishes.

- **DuckLink** sends `Hello from DUCKLINK C:<n>` on `topics::sensor` every `SEND_INTERVAL_MS`. A DuckLink doesn't relay messages from other ducks.
- **MamaDuck** sends the same message as `MAMADUCK` and relays the messages of other ducks. Relaying needs no code: `duck.run()` does it.
- **PapaDuck** joins your WiFi network (set `WIFI_SSID` and `WIFI_PASS`), connects to `test.mosquitto.org` over TLS and publishes every message it receives as JSON on `hub/event`:

  ```json
  {"from":"hub","to":"controller","RE":false,"eventType":"sensor","MessageID":"K3TQ","payload":{"hops":0,"duckType":2,"DeviceID":"MAMADUCK","Message":"Hello from MAMADUCK C:7"}}
  ```

  It also prints what arrives on `incoming/say_hello`, and reconnects to the broker every 5 s after a drop. Pings and pongs aren't published. `web/` holds a small browser page that shows the published messages.
- **DetectorDuck** broadcasts a ping every 5 s. Every duck in direct range answers with a pong, and the detector logs the RSSI and SNR of each answer. On boards that define `CDPCFG_PIN_LED1` it shows the strongest answer on a WS2812 LED: green above -95 dBm, blue above -108 dBm, purple above -118 dBm, and red for weaker or no answer. On boards without the pin, such as the Heltec V3, the result goes to serial only. A DetectorDuck relays nothing and sends no health messages.

## Custom-Mama-Examples

**Full-MamaDuck** is a MamaDuck with more than the basics:

- a JSON reading on `topics::sensor` every 30 s, with a counter, uptime, free heap and a UTC timestamp once the clock is valid
- a WS2812 status LED for setup, queued readings, send errors and received packets, with non-blocking flashes. It builds and runs without the LED on boards that have no `CDPCFG_PIN_LED1`.
- remote time sync, remote TX power and deep sleep, all off by default, with the build flags to turn them on

See [its README](Custom-Mama-Examples/Full-MamaDuck/README.md). QuackPack sensors will plug in at the hook in `sendReading()`; QuackPack integration and a guide for it come later.

## Custom-Papa-Examples

**AWS-PapaDuck** publishes every message it receives to AWS IoT Core, on `owl/device/<THINGNAME>/evt/<topic>`. While MQTT is down it keeps up to 5 messages in a queue and publishes them after it reconnects. Set the WiFi network in the sketch, and the thing name, endpoint and certificates in `secrets.h`. It needs the PubSubClient library (`libraries.txt`).

## External-Boards-Example

**DuckLink** shows how to build for a board that isn't in `src/include/boards`. With `-DCDP_EXTERNAL_BOARD`, CDP includes `cdp_external_board.h` from the sketch folder instead of its own board list, and that file picks `my-boards/<board>/board_config.h`. The folder has its own `platformio.ini` (envs `heltec_wifi_lora_paper` and `heltec_cubecell_gps`), which takes the CDP 5.5.0 release from GitHub, so build it as a separate PlatformIO project. CDP 5.5 supports ESP32 boards only, so only the Heltec Wireless Paper (ESP32-S3) configuration applies; the CubeCell one shows the file format.

## Building

### PlatformIO

From the CDP folder, set `EXAMPLE_DIR` to the example's folder under `examples/` and pick an environment. Without `EXAMPLE_DIR`, PlatformIO builds `Basic-Ducks/MamaDuck`.

```bash
EXAMPLE_DIR=Basic-Ducks/DuckLink pio run -e local_heltec_wifi_lora_32_V3              # build
EXAMPLE_DIR=Basic-Ducks/DuckLink pio run -e local_heltec_wifi_lora_32_V3 -t upload    # build and flash
EXAMPLE_DIR=Custom-Mama-Examples/Full-MamaDuck pio run -e local_lilygo_t_beam_sx1262
```

On Windows (PowerShell), set the variable first:

```powershell
$env:EXAMPLE_DIR="Basic-Ducks/DuckLink"
pio run -e local_heltec_wifi_lora_32_V3 -t upload
```

| Environment | Board | LED pin (`CDPCFG_PIN_LED1`) |
|---|---|---|
| `local_heltec_wifi_lora_32_V3` | Heltec WiFi LoRa 32 V3 | none |
| `local_heltec_wifi_lora_32_V2` | Heltec WiFi LoRa 32 V2 | 13 |
| `local_lilygo_t_beam_sx1262` | LilyGO T-Beam SX1262 | 4 |
| `local_lilygo_t_beam_sx1276` | TTGO LoRa32 V1 (SX1276) | 4 |
| `local_ttgo_lora32_v1_3` | TTGO LoRa32 V1.3 | 4 |

`local_` environments build against the CDP source in this folder; the matching `prod_` environments use the CDP 5.5.0 release from GitHub. To add a build flag, such as one of the opt-in settings below:

```bash
PLATFORMIO_BUILD_FLAGS="-DCDPCFG_REMOTE_TIME_SYNC=1" EXAMPLE_DIR=Custom-Mama-Examples/Full-MamaDuck pio run -e local_heltec_wifi_lora_32_V3
```

### Arduino IDE

1. Install the ESP32 board package and the ClusterDuck Protocol library, with the libraries it depends on: arduino-timer, ArduinoJson, CRC32, RadioLib, PubSubClient and FastLED.
2. Open the example from File > Examples > ClusterDuck Protocol.
3. Select your board. For the PapaDuck examples, also pick a partition scheme without OTA, such as "No OTA (2MB APP/2MB SPIFFS)" (see below).
4. Upload, and open the serial monitor at 115200 baud.

The Basic-Ducks, Full-MamaDuck and External-Boards sketches print with `Serial`, so their output shows in both tools. The CDP library's own log lines, and those of AWS-PapaDuck, use CDP's logger, which needs `-D CDP_INFO`; the PlatformIO configuration sets it. Build flags such as `CDPCFG_REMOTE_TIME_SYNC` are set with PlatformIO.

## Notes for writing a 5.5 sketch

- **No network join.** A duck can send as soon as `setupWithDefaults()` returns `DUCK_ERR_NONE`. Ducks in one mesh need the same radio settings; the default is 915 MHz.
- **`sendData()` queues.** It returns `DUCK_ERR_NONE` once the message is in the transmit queue, which isn't a delivery receipt. Otherwise it returns an error code: `DUCK_ERR_QUEUE_FULL` when the queue (10 packets) is full, `DUCKPACKET_ERR_SIZE_INVALID` for an empty payload or one over 228 bytes (`MAX_DATA_LENGTH`), and `DUCK_ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED` before setup or after `prepareForSleep()`. `getDuckErrorString(err)` turns a code into text. A duck transmits at most once every 3 s.
- **`topics::health` belongs to CDP.** Every duck except a DetectorDuck sends its own health message on it every 15 minutes. Send your data on `topics::sensor`, `topics::status` or another topic.
- **The PapaDuck receives every copy.** Its `onReceiveDuckData()` callback gets each copy of a message that reaches it through a different relay, plus pings and pongs. Remove duplicates downstream by message ID, or call `muidNotReceived()` to drop them locally. The PapaDuck's own health also arrives in the callback, as a packet from itself with hop count 0, so publish it like the others. A MamaDuck or DuckLink callback also gets every packet it hears.
- **PapaDuck partitions.** WiFi, TLS and MQTT don't fit the default 1.25 MB app partition. The root `platformio.ini` sets `board_build.partitions = no_ota.csv`; do the same in your own PapaDuck project.
- **Opt-in settings, off by default.** `CDPCFG_REMOTE_TIME_SYNC=1` sets the clock from a PapaDuck's `topics::cmd_time`, `CDPCFG_REMOTE_TX_POWER=1` accepts TX power commands, and `CDPCFG_REMOTE_COMMANDS=1` turns on both. The commands aren't authenticated. With them off, MamaDucks still relay them. `hasValidTime()` tells whether the clock holds a valid time. A PapaDuck shares a trusted time with `sendTimeSync(epoch)`; none of these examples sends one.
- **Deep sleep.** Keep calling `run()` until `txIdle()` is true (with a timeout), then call `prepareForSleep()` and `esp_deep_sleep_start()`. Waking up is a reboot. A sleeping MamaDuck doesn't relay.
- **Device IDs** are 8 characters and must be unique in the mesh.
- **Board pins.** Use `#ifdef CDPCFG_PIN_LED1` around LED code, because not every board defines it. On T-Beam boards, GPIO 16 and 17 are PSRAM lines. The T-Beam's OLED is optional; build with `-D ENABLE_DISPLAY` when one is fitted.

[Open-mesh routing, health and diagnostics](../docs/open-mesh-routing.md) describes the mesh, the health and signal messages, time sync and deep sleep in detail.
