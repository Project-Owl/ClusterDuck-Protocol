/**
 * @file Full-MamaDuck.ino
 * @brief A full-featured MamaDuck for the ClusterDuck Protocol (CDP) 5.5.
 *
 * Like every MamaDuck, it relays the messages it hears from other ducks. On
 * top of Basic-Ducks/MamaDuck it:
 * - sends a JSON reading on topics::sensor every SEND_INTERVAL_MS, such as
 *   {"count":12,"uptimeS":360,"freeHeap":291340,"utc":1767225600}
 *   "utc" (UTC seconds since 1970) is only included once the clock holds a
 *   valid time; see hasValidTime() and option 1 below.
 * - shows what it does on a WS2812 RGB LED, on boards that define
 *   CDPCFG_PIN_LED1:
 *     cyan          starting
 *     gold          running
 *     red           setup failed
 *     green flash   reading queued
 *     red flash     reading not queued (the serial log has the error)
 *     blue flash    packet heard (see handleDuckData())
 *   On boards without CDPCFG_PIN_LED1, such as the Heltec WiFi LoRa 32 V3, it
 *   builds and runs the same, without the LED.
 * - logs every result to serial, at 115200 baud.
 *
 * sendData() returns DUCK_ERR_NONE once a reading is queued for the radio,
 * which is not a delivery receipt. CDP also sends the duck's own health on
 * topics::health every 15 minutes, so readings use another topic.
 *
 * Optional features, all off by default:
 *
 * 1. Remote time sync and TX power. These are CDP build flags, not code in
 *    this sketch:
 *      -DCDPCFG_REMOTE_TIME_SYNC=1  set the clock from topics::cmd_time. Readings
 *                                   get "utc" once a PapaDuck has sent the time
 *                                   with sendTimeSync(); the CDP example
 *                                   PapaDucks don't send it.
 *      -DCDPCFG_REMOTE_TX_POWER=1   accept topics::cmd_tx TX power commands, such
 *                                   as {"txPwr":20} (14 to 22 dBm). The duck
 *                                   stores the value and uses it from its next
 *                                   boot. SX1276 boards (Heltec V2, TTGO LoRa32)
 *                                   only take 14 to 17 or 20 dBm: with another
 *                                   value stored, setup fails at every boot
 *                                   until the flash (NVS) is erased.
 *      -DCDPCFG_REMOTE_COMMANDS=1   both
 *    Neither command is authenticated: anything in radio range can send one.
 *    With them off, the duck still relays them for other ducks. To build with
 *    PlatformIO from the CDP folder:
 *      PLATFORMIO_BUILD_FLAGS="-DCDPCFG_REMOTE_TIME_SYNC=1" \
 *        EXAMPLE_DIR=Custom-Mama-Examples/Full-MamaDuck \
 *        pio run -e local_heltec_wifi_lora_32_V3
 *    or add the flag to build_flags in your own platformio.ini.
 *
 * 2. Deep sleep: change `#define ENABLE_DEEP_SLEEP 0` below to 1, or build with
 *    -DENABLE_DEEP_SLEEP=1. WARNING: a sleeping MamaDuck receives and relays
 *    nothing, so ducks that depend on it lose their path to the PapaDuck. Use
 *    it only for a duck that no other duck needs as a relay.
