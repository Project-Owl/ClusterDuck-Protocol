/**
 * @file DuckLink.ino
 * @brief A DuckLink for a board that CDP doesn't define itself.
 *
 * The board's pins come from my-boards/<board>/board_config.h. When the build
 * defines CDP_EXTERNAL_BOARD, CDP includes cdp_external_board.h from this
 * folder instead of its own board list, and that file picks the board_config.h
 * for the board the build names (see the .ini file in each my-boards folder).
 * The sketch itself is a plain DuckLink that starts and keeps running.
